      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a software developer based in Abuja, Nigeria, with a background in
        Engineering. I’ve enhanced my skills through bootcamps with Scrimba and
        am currently advancing my knowledge with ALX. Passionate about building
        practical personal projects, I strive to deliver clean, efficient, and
        scalable code.

        <h3>Password Generator</h3>
        <p>
          This project is a customizable password generator that allows users to
          create secure passwords up to 50 characters in length. Users can
          adjust the password length using a slider and select which types of
          characters to include—numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters,
          and special characters. The generator dynamically creates strong
          passwords based on the selected criteria, providing an easy and
          flexible way to enhance account security

        <h3>Digital Scoreboard</h3>
        <p>
          This digital scoreboard tracks the scores of two teams, Team A and
          Team B, during a game. Users can update the scores in real-time as the
          game progresses. The scoreboard displays the current scores clearly
          and provides a final result at the end of the game. Additionally, it
          includes a reset feature that allows users to clear the scores and
          start fresh for a new game.

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve always loved tackling challenges—math was my thing because it
        pushes you to think differently. After studying engineering and working
        in renewable energy and CCTV, I wanted something that would really test
        me mentally. That’s why I moved into software development. Now, I get to
        use my problem-solving skills to build web apps that help businesses run
        smoother and smarter.
